 **Note:** The library uses a default MongoDb database hosted on [MongoDB Atlas]. I make the database IP public. I don't know whether you can use it.
If you cann't use my database. You can first create a new blogger, then create a new genre, at last create a new blog.  

## Introduction
This is local Blog website. You can create blogger, create blog genre and post blogs.
The web shows lists of all the existing items in the database in homepage
User can click the navigation and url to see the details of each individual item when the user selects
